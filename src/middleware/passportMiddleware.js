// Passport session setup.
//   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to
//   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session. Typically,
//   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding
//   the user by ID when deserializing. However, since this example does not
//   have a database of user records, the complete spotify profile is serialized
//   and deserialized.
